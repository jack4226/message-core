Dear df153 (df153@aim.com),

Thank you for your bid on the following auction-style listing:

Item number:  250115131181
Title:  Canon S50 Digital Camera Like New W/All Accessories

Unfortunately, eBay has removed this auction-style listing. All bids or offe=
rs on this listing have been canceled. Because the listing was ended, you no=
 longer have any obligation to purchase this item. If the seller chooses to=20=
relist the item, you're welcome to bid on it again.

Listings are removed for different reasons. For example:
- The way the item was listed may violate eBay policy.
- The removal may be part of a separate action taken by eBay that is unrelat=
ed to the listing itself.=20

We hope you understand that, due to privacy concerns, we're unable to discus=
s the details of why this listing was ended. However, please note that the r=
emoval of this listing should not suggest that this seller's standing in the=
 eBay Community has been called into question.

For more information on why eBay may remove a listing, please go to:

 http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/listing-ended.html
