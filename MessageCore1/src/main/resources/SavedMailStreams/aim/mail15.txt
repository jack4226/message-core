Dear df153,

I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy Po=
licy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of Ma=
y 16, 2007, and on July 9, 2007, for current users.

eBay User Agreement =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/1891478.68979.0.40451
eBay Privacy Policy =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/1891478.68979.0.40453

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to in the Us=
er Agreement have not changed in any substantive way. We've made some change=
s to this agreement to make sure our legal documents are consistent with the=
 ways our sites and services are evolving and to better meet the needs of ou=
r user community. You'll notice some changes to our "Content License" and "A=
busing eBay" sections to that effect.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of i=
nformation we collect from you, how we use this information, and what your o=
ptions are with respect to the information we collect. You'll notice a few c=
hanges to the policy, which we've made to cover new programs and site safety=
 projects we're putting in place.

---------------
Combating Fraud
---------------
We're increasing our efforts to combat fraud on the site with a variety of p=
rograms. For example, we've made some changes that allow us to address "Ask=20=
a Question" and "My Messages" spam and other malicious activities using our=20=
message systems. And we're making sure our disclosures about cooperating wit=
h law enforcement allow us to respond to increasingly sophisticated fraudste=
rs and criminals.

---------------------
Streamlining Services
---------------------
We've heard your comments about how many steps it takes to complete a transa=
ction or get customer support where multiple eBay companies are involved. So=
 we've made some changes that will allow our Customer Support team to help y=
ou with questions that span our companies. And we're streamlining your use o=
f the services provided by members of the eBay corporate family, so your exp=
erience across the eBay Inc. platform will be as seamless as we can make it.=
 Some of our new programs also mean you'll see eBay services and content in=20=
a lot of places (not just on the site), so we've made some changes to reflec=
t that.

--------------------------------
Customizing Your eBay Experience
--------------------------------
We're rolling out programs and working with partners that help make our site=
s and services, and some of the ads you see on the web, more relevant and us=
eful to you. Naturally, because we're a transparent community, we'll identif=
y the new ads served with this program and provide you with choices about th=
em. Beginning in July, we'll make a new preference available in My eBay--nam=
ed AdChoice--that lets you tell us whether you want us to use the informatio=
n we have about you to customize the ads you see. You'll be able to sign in=20=
and change your advertising preferences in My eBay at any time. You'll also=20=
notice links on the ads we serve this way, so you'll know an ad is served wi=
th the new program and be able to set your preferences right from the ad.

We hope you'll agree that these changes will make the eBay sites and service=
s work better for you. If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Poli=
cy, you don't need to take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new=20=
User Agreement or Privacy Policy, please refer to our Help pages for instruc=
tions on how to close your account.

Thank you for using eBay and we look forward to many more successful transac=
tions!

Sincerely,

Scott Shipman
Counsel -- Global Privacy Practices
eBay Inc.
