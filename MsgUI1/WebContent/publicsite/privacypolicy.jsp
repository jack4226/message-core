At Emailsphere, we respect and protect the privacy of our customers and those who visit our website. 
The following Privacy Statement provides details about how your personal information is collected and used.<p/> 
<font color="darkblue"><b>Information Collection and Use</b></font><br/>
Emailsphere is the sole owner of information collected on this site. For each visitor to our web site, 
our web server automatically recognizes no information regarding the domain or e-mail address.<p/>
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who subscribe to our newsletter or order our products. 
Information collected from customers is used for order notification and to send product information only. 
It is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.<p/>
Those who have signed up and subsequently wish to withdraw their participation may opt-out of receiving 
future mailings at any time (see the choice/opt-out section below).<p/>
<font color="darkblue"><b>Security and Privacy</b></font><br/>
We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using 
industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security 
procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. When we collect 
sensitive account information such as credit card numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of 
encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<p/>
We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with third parties for their promotional use.
Occasionally, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for 
example, providing customer service). The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal 
information for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the 
information we provide to them. Lastly, we may disclose or report personal information in limited 
circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we 
may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement 
authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law 
enforcement request.<p/>
<font color="darkblue"><b>Cookies</b></font><br/>
We use a variety of technologies on our sites. Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information 
that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website 
can remember your browser in the future. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which 
the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a unique number. When you visit our 
website, we may send you a cookie. Cookies may be used in many ways: they allow us to recognize your 
computer while you are on our Web site and help us customize your online experience and make it more 
convenient for you. Cookies are also useful in allowing more efficient login for users, tracking transaction 
histories and preserving information between sessions. The information collected from cookies may also be 
used to improve the functionality of the Web site.<p/>
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. You have 
the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. If you choose to disable 
cookies, you may still use our site; however, you may have limited access to some areas within our website.<p/>
<font color="darkblue"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></font><br/>
Emailsphere's Anti-Spam policy tolerates only permission-based email. In addition, users always have the 
opportunity to opt-out or change preferences via a link in the footer of all non-transactional email messages. 
These options are made available when you sign-up for our email lists and in email messages sent from us. 
Alternatively, you may email us at <a href="mailto:support@emailsphere.com">support@emailsphere.com</a>.<p/>
Some communications (e.g. important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional 
and are necessary for all Emailsphere customers. You must cancel your Emailsphere account to unsubscribe from 
these communications. To cancel your Emailsphere account, please email us at 
<a href="mailto:support@emailsphere.com">support@emailsphere.com</a>.<p/>
<font color="darkblue"><b>Links</b></font><br/>
Some of our sites provide links to third-party websites, such as those of our business partners and online 
advertising partners. While on these sites, Emailsphere or its partners may collect information about you. 
Because Emailsphere does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should 
review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personally identifiable information.<p/>
<font color="darkblue"><b>Notification of Changes</b></font><br/>
Emailsphere may amend this policy from time to time. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
those changes on the Emailsphere Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how 
we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.<p/>
