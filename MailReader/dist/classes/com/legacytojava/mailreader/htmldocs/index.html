      <td width="708"> Java Agent Container is an abstract layer that separates 
        common tasks from applications, thus saves programmers from low level 
        programming such as threading logic, low level JMS logic, socket logic, 
        configuration logic, and etc.</td>

      <td height="71" width="708">It is xml file driven, all resources are defined 
        by config.xml. Applications are plug-in classes that are defined in the 
        config.xml. Resources are loaded at start up time, and are visible to 
        applications. Requests are accepted by the Container and passed to the 
        application processors. Application programmers need only to focus on 
        the business logic.</td>

        since the worker thread is already created, started, and running. It is

      <td width="708">Four general types of applications can be developed and 
        deployed under the Container: 1) Queue driven applications, 2) Socket 
        driven applications, 3) pop3/imap driven applications, 4) Applications 
        that have no driving source</td>

        This page represents an implementation of RMA using the Container. Two 
        servers are running under the Container, one is MailReader server that 
        serves pop3/imap messages, another is a simple HTTP server that displays 
        this page and RMA's runtime <a href="status?name=MailReader&amp;days=1">status</a> 
        in last 24 hours, Or click this to get <a href="status?name=MailReader&amp;days=100">all 
        status</a>.</td>
