Hello,

I am trying to implement domain keys to my bulleten software.

The problem I am having is that I cannot insert the header at the top of the mail. 
Javamail sorts the headers based on some internal priority and I cannot get the 
DomainKey-Signature above the other headers neighter get the sender or from below 
DomainKey-Signature header.

I checked if I can provide an alternative streaming to insert the DomainKey-Signature 
into the beginning but I can get the contents from the stream but there seems to be
no alternative stream provision.

Is there any workaround to that problem?

Answer 1:

You can control the order of headers, but it's not easy.
JavaMail 1.4 added the ability to subclass the InternetHeaders
class and access the list of headers, allowing you the ability
to control the order of headers, among other things. You would
also want to subclass MimeMessage to cause it to use your
subclass of the InternetHeaders class.

If that's not enough of a clue to get you started, let me know.


Answer 2:

Here's a more complete sketch. You'll need to fill it in, add missing
constructors, etc. The key is that your InternetHeaders subclass can
access the protected headers List that contains InternetHeaders objects,
and you can insert new items wherever you want them in the list.

public class MyMimeMessage {
 
    MyInternetHeaders ih;
 
    protected InternetHeaders createInternetHeaders(InputStream is)
                                throws MessagingException {
        ih = new MyInternetHeaders(is);
        return ih;
    }
 
    public void addDomainKeys(whatever) {
        ih.addDomainKeys(whatever);
    }
}
 
public class MyInternetHeaders extends InternetHeaders {
    public MyInternetHeaders(InputStream is) throws MessagingException {
        super(is);
    }
 
    public void addDomainKeys(whatever) {
        headers.add(0, new InternetHeader("whatever", "whatever");
    }
}
