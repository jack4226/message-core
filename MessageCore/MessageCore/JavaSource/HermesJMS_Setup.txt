
HermesJMS: 
	Embedded HornetQ installations within JBoss AS 7.1 Final
	

PREMISES
When I start I can see the AS7 I can see in the log the RemoteConnectionFactory JNDI, this cannot
be seen in the console:9990 because of mentioned bugs in the earlier comments.

12:47:16,653 INFO  [org.jboss.as.messaging] (pool-4-thread-2) JBAS011601: Bound messaging object to jndi name java:jboss/exported/jms/RemoteConnectionFactory

Then I have setup a JMS Queue with the following configuration:
<jms-queue name="sample">
<entry name="jms/queue/sample"/>
<entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/sample"/>
</jms-queue>
 
In summary from a REMOTE PERSPECTIVE: the RemoteConnectionFactory is on 
java:jboss/exported/jms/RemoteConnectionFactory, the Queue is on java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/sample
 
1) CONFIGURING HermesJMS
Create a classpath group for HornetQ in HermesJMS
Only one JAR is needed, is the jboss-client.jar inside the directory bin\client of the JBoss AS 7 directory.

2) Configure a HornetQ session in HermesJMS:
Class: hermes.JNDIContextFactory
Loader: HornetQ - the one defined in step #1
Properties:
binding=jms/RemoteConnectionFactory
initialContextFactory=org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory
providerURL=remote://localhost:4447
securityPrincipal=MYUSERNAME
securityCredentials=MYPASSWORD
urlPkgPrefixes=org.jboss.naming.remote.client.

3) In the Destionations of the HornetQ session which you are defining as part of step #2, Add a new 
Desitionation
Name: jms/queue/sample
Domain: QUEUE

Now in HermesJMS in the left tree structure you have your Sessions -> Your Session -> Queue which you 
can double-click to connect to =)

Nice and Happily!

You want to notice that for the binding you set the RemoteConnectionFactory without the 
java:jboss/exported prefix, and the same goes for the Queue defined, where from 
java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/sample I stripped away the java:jboss/exported prefix

Also notice that you can define the username/password either via the 
(securityPrincipal,securityCredentials) properties as above, or either use the "Connection" settings 
fields (User, Password) at the bottom of the Session Preference page of step#2

Tested with:
HermesJMS v1.14
JBoss AS 7.1.1 Final.
